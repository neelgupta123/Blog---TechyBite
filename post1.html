                            Web hosting definition. When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a
                            website to store its files, they are hosting a website. Web hosting makes the files that
                            comprise a website (code, images, etc.) available for viewing online. All the files that are
                            being used to make a website are stored on a server location. When you upload the files,
                            they are downloaded from there and store on a disk so that anyone on the internet can access
                            the files. If you want a site to be hosted on the internet from your house, you should have
                            a PC/Laptop that should be turned on 24/7 and needs a router for port forwarding.

                            Suppose you buy good hosting services, then there 0.01% of going your site down. The site
                            going down means there can be electricity or internet issues in the data centers. So, their
                            servers can be turned off so your website can be down. To avoid this you should buy a
                            premium hosting (purchased)

                            Blogging platforms like Medium, Blogger, Tumblr, LinkedIn, wordpress.com does not give full
                            access to the site, so you can't make many changes. But if you make a site from
                            wordpress.org or install WordPress from your hosting provider, you have full access to your
                            site and make any changes.

                            2GB or max. 10GB storage is not enough for any site made on WordPress or a heavy HTML & CSS
                            site. And if you want to make an e-commerce site, your min. Need 10GB storage for big sites.

                            Let's see how free hosting affects Ranking. When free hosting gives you a free domain name
                            like mysite.subdomain.com, this is a subdomain. The Main domain has bought by the free
                            hosting company. Any subdomain does not rank easily as the Main domain does. They also give
                            ads on the sites. And the loading speed of the site is shallow, so and search engine don't
                            want that their users suffer from the slow speed of any site

                            Bandwidth is the internet speed and the amount of internet transferred from the servers to
                            the client(user). If you want your website to be fast, then you should have good bandwidth
                            and Do you know that how much GB bandwidth you have depends on the no. of users who can
                            visit your site in a month?

                            <br>

                            Customer support in most of the paid hosting services gives 24/7 support. But in free
                            hosting, most of them didn't even reply. In some, they reply in 2-4 weeks. Customer support
                            is essential because if the user is facing problems, issues, or need help in the site's

                            SSL is a certificate that ensures users that the site is safe and secure. But you can't get
